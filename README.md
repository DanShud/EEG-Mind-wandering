**Dan Shudrenko: 11/30 (2 hours):**
- Creating general setup, e.g. github repositiories, readme file 
- Figured the way to acess the data in needed format
- Get acustomed with the data type and come with the conceptual implementaipon of the project

**Dan Shudrenko and Kai: 12/2 (2.5 hours):**
- Figured out how to extract data
- (Kai) understood data.
- data is 2048 hz

**Kai: 12/3 (2 hours):**
- Modified matlab script
- Wrote powershell script to iterate over subjects and get data as csv 
- extracted some sample data

**Dan: 12/3 (1 hours):**
- Mannually downloaded and converted all the data: I HATE SOFRTWARE FOR PSYCHOLOFY RESEARCH

**Dan: 12/4 (4 hours):**
- Featurized the data

**Kai: 12/4 (1 hours):**
- Developed function for extracting band frequncies

**Dan and Kai: 12/5 (1 hours):**
- Debugging

**Dan, Kai and Ben: 12/5 (1 hours):**
